# cmacc-ui
CommonAccord Code
=================
This library is included in to Common Accord web sites.
It repleaces the original cmacc library.
It is the code that runs the siste.

There are two parts to every CommonAccord site:

1. Documents and configuration code
2. Code that runs the website (this library)
 
New Fetures
-----------
The "Edit and Complete" feature has been revised so a
user friendly series of pages and web forms (with help text) that can be filled out by a user.
These pages and forms replace a textbox or ascii editor of input lines that was difficult to understand.

This improved user esperiance (UI) is generated by a shadow file that contains codeing and HTML.
The shadow files name is the same as the documents name, but ends with `.dot`

1. Create the file `Doc/H4KC/Form/form.md` with the following line in it

    ````
    =[H4KC/Form/Master_DSA.md]
    ````
    
2. Create the file `form.dot` with the following content.  
    Lines with starting with a period can not have leading spaces.

    ````
    .page Q1|Questions

Installing
==========

To create a development site:

1. Create a local web site that will serve PHP code.  Apache is the most common server for this.  
2. Do not forget to add the site to your `/etc/localhosts` file
3. In the directory of the web site, clone the repository that you will wnat to work with

    ````
    git clone git@github.com:CommonAccord/Site-DataShare.git .
    ````
    
4. Configure composer to include this library instead of the standard library.  
    In `composer.json` change the `url` line in the `repositories` section and the
    `require` section.  The file should contain the following lines:

    ````
    {
        "name": "CommonAccord/CommonAccord",
        "repositories": [
            {
                "type": "vcs",
                "url": "https://github.com/UMKC-Law/cmacc-ui.git"
            }
        ],
        "require": {
            "CommonAccord/cmacc-ui": "dev-master"
        }
    }
    ````
    
5. Remove the current `vendor` folder
6. Remove the file `composer.lock`
6. Regenerate the `vendor` folder by running Composer
    
    ````
    composer install
    ````

    you should see the following lines
    
    ````
    Loading composer repositories with package information
    Updating dependencies (including require-dev)

      - Installing components/jquery (2.1.4)
        Loading from cache

      - Installing twbs/bootstrap (v3.3.5)
        Loading from cache

    > cp -R vendor/CommonAccord/cmacc-ui/js/ public/js/
    ````
    
    where xxxxxx is replaced by a random number.
    
7. Verify that `index.php` points to the new `cmacc-ui` library.  
Make sure the `LIB_PATH` line is:
    
    ````
    DEFINE('LIB_PATH', ROOT . '/vendor/CommonAccord/cmacc-ui/library');
    ````
8. Make sure that the following lines are in `index.php`

    ````
    DEFINE('TEXT_EDIT_WINDOW_SIZE', 'cols=120 rows=30'); // Sets the size of the text edit window in
                                                         //   both edit.php and openedit.php
    DEFINE('TEXT_EDIT_AREA_STYLE', 'font-size: 16px; padding:10px;');  
    DEFINE('LANDING_MD', 'ZZZ/landing.md'); // The repo home
    DEFINE('SOURCE_TAB_MESSAGE', 'Source'); 
    DEFINE('EDIT_TAB_MESSAGE', 'Edit'); 
    DEFINE('COMPLETE_TAB_MESSAGE', 'Edit and Complete');    
    DEFINE('DOC_TAB_MESSAGE', 'Document');  
    DEFINE('PRINT_TAB_MESSAGE', 'Print');     ````
    ````

You should now be able to browse to your new site.
